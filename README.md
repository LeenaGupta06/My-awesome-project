   ## How the Board Will Be Used  

1. **Organize Tasks**:  
   - Begin by adding all tasks to the **To Do** column.  
   - Prioritize tasks based on importance and deadlines.  

2. **Track Progress**:  
   - Move tasks to the **In Progress** column once work begins.  
   - Keep track of ongoing tasks and ensure accountability.  

3. **Monitor Completion**:  
   - Transfer tasks to the **Done** column when completed.  
   - Use this column to visualize team accomplishments.  

4. **Facilitate Collaboration**:  
   - Assign tasks directly to team members from the board.  
   - Ensure everyone is clear on their responsibilities.  

5. **Review and Adjust**:  
   - During team meetings, review the board to identify blockers or inefficiencies.  
   - Reprioritize tasks or reassign them as needed to maintain workflow.  

## Reflection on GitHub Project Management Tools  

GitHub's project management tools, including milestones, issues, and project boards, have been incredibly useful in organizing my portfolio project:  

- **Milestones**:  
  Helped me divide the project into smaller, focused goals, making progress easier to track.  

- **Issues**:  
  Allowed me to document specific tasks or problems, ensuring I stay on top of every detail.  

- **Project Board**:  
  Provided a clear overview of task statuses, showing whatâ€™s completed, in progress, and pending.  

### Key Benefits  
By linking issues to milestones, I could keep my work structured and prioritize efficiently. The combination of these tools has simplified project management, making it easy to identify what needs attention next.  

### Potential Challenge  
One issue I foresee is forgetting to update the project board, which could lead to disorganization.
